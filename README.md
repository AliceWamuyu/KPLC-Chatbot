## BUILDING A CHATBOT USING AN RNN

# 1.0. Business Understanding 

# 1.1. Overview 

Automation of tasks is a technique that aids in the improval of productivity in organizations. One of the key areas that can be automated is customer service. Given a large customer base, how do you filter out the lower level problems and address them while allowing only the complex problems to reach the relevant personnel for attention? Integrating a chatbot into the problem solving process can aid in this significantly. By having a chatbot that can address simple queries and also redirect the complex problems to relevant personnel, productivity can be improved as well as the overall efficiency of the organization.

# 1.2. Business Problem 

Task automation is at the heart of improving a company’s productivity. In order to respond to a large customer base’s needs effectively, it may not be feasible to use human personnel who are prone to fatigue, as well as other limitations. It is also very expensive. To solve this problem, a chatbot can be employed. Autonomous in its query response, it will alleviate some of the workload of the customer service team freeing them to tackle harder problems posed by customers.  

KPLC is a government parastatal that is tasked with the distribution of electricity to homes and industries in Kenya. Given the large population of Kenyans, around 53million, many of whom have access to smartphones and internet, KPLC receives several complaints each and every day. Many of them are through their social media account on Twitter. Some of these responses would better be served through an chatbot which would be able to answer the queries of most of its customer base while designating the harder queries to the relevant personnel. KPLC would like to contract a data science team to build a chatbot that can be integrated into its website as well as any other platform like twitter to cater to its customer base.



# 1.3. Objectives


 To build a chatbot that can process text data and give responses to queries in alignment with a business’ policies and practices.

 		# 1.3.1. Specific Objectives 

To use NLP techniques to analyze the text data to extract patterns useful in training the model.
To build a model that can respond with high levels of accuracy to the problems posed to it by a customer.
To evaluate the performance of the model using relevant metrics in order to ensure accurate responses.
To interpret the model results and gain insights some of the main challenges facing KPLC customers. 




# 1.4. Success Criteria 

The model will be considered a success if it is able to correctly respond to customer queries as well as solve customer problems in accordance with company policies.
